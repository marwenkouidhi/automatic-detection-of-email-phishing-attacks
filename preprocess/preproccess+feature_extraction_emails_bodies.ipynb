       "      <td>b'Dear Johann and Gabor,\\n\\nIt\\'s what amounts to large datasets. There are hundreds of datasets R\\ncan\\'t handle, probably thousands or more. I noticed on my computer\\n(which is nothing more that an average PC) that R breaks down after 250\\nMB of memory. I also note that SPSS breaks down, Matlab, etc.\\n\\nI\\'m not a SAS user, but I have worked in the past with SAS. It\\'s very\\ngood as a remember, but it\\'s ten years ago. And it\\'s a \"dollar machine\"\\nI\\'ve been told: you add dollars to SAS as you add dollars to a Porsche.\\nI haven\\'t got it and for most statistical applications it isn\\'t\\nnecessary I\\'ve been told. R is sufficient for that. The datasets I use\\nare often not that big (the way I like it).\\nAbout three years ago I spoke to somebody who has worked with it and\\nsaid \"it\\'s database system is excellent and statistical profound\".\\nSomeone with a PhD, so probably he is right.\\n\\nMonte-Carlo simulations are computationally time-consuming, but probably\\nthese can be done in R. I haven\\'t seen any libaries for it (they might\\nbe there). It has been done with S (the commercial counterpart of R), so\\nprobably with R too. If you tie Monte Carlo simulaton with large\\ndatasets you probably run into problems with a conventional R system.\\nWhat I\\'ve been told in those instances is \"buy a new computer\" / \"add\\nmemory and buy a new processor\"... and don\\'t smoke hashiesh.\\n\\nThat wasn\\'t a good advice because the guy who told me smoked hashiesh\\nlike hell and drank Pastis (blue liqor) like water. I kicked him out.\\nBut that\\'s another story.\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\nWilfred\\n\\n(I drink wine and tailor made beer, and only on occasions. That\\'s why.\\nHis simulations were good I\\'ve been told.)\\n\\n______________________________________________\\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\\n\\n'</td>\n",

There are hundreds of datasets R\\ncan\\'t handle, probably thousands or more. I noticed on my computer\\n(which is nothing more that an average PC) that R breaks down after 250\\nMB of memory. I also note that SPSS breaks down, Matlab, etc.\\n\\nI\\'m not a SAS user, but I have worked in the past with SAS. It\\'s very\\ngood as a remember, but it\\'s ten years ago. And it\\'s a \"dollar machine\"\\nI\\'ve been told: you add dollars to SAS as you add dollars to a Porsche.\\nI haven\\'t got it and for most statistical applications it isn\\'t\\nnecessary I\\'ve been told. R is sufficient for that. The datasets I use\\nare often not that big (the way I like it).\\nAbout three years ago I spoke to somebody who has worked with it and\\nsaid \"it\\'s database system is excellent and statistical profound\".\\nSomeone with a PhD, so probably he is right.\\n\\nMonte-Carlo simulations are computationally time-consuming, but probably\\nthese can be done in R. I haven\\'t seen any libaries for it (they might\\nbe there). It has been done with S (the commercial counterpart of R), so\\nprobably with R too. If you tie Monte Carlo simulaton with large\\ndatasets you probably run into problems with a conventional R system.\\nWhat I\\'ve been told in those instances is \"buy a new computer\" / \"add\\nmemory and buy a new processor\"... and don\\'t smoke hashiesh.\\n\\nThat wasn\\'t a good advice because the guy who told me smoked hashiesh\\nlike hell and drank Pastis (blue liqor) like water. I kicked him out.\\nBut that\\'s another story.\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\nWilfred\\n\\n(I drink wine and tailor made beer, and only on occasions. That\\'s why.\\nHis simulations were good I\\'ve been told.)\\n\\n______________________________________________\\nR-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list\\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help\\nPLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html\\nand provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.\\n\\n'   \n",

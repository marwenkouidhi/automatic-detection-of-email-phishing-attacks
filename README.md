# ðŸ“§ Automatic Detection of Email Phishing Attacks ðŸš«ðŸŽ£

This project aims to automatically detect email phishing attacks using multiple models:

- **Model 1: NLP-based classification** uses natural language processing techniques to classify emails as phishing or not phishing based on the email's content.
- **Model 2: Abnormality detection based on email headers** checks for abnormalities in the email headers that might indicate a phishing attempt.
- **Model 3: Unwanted content detection** checks for unwanted or suspicious content, such as malicious links or attachments, that might indicate a phishing attempt.
